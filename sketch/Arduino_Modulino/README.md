# ðŸ§© Arduino ModulinoÂ® Library

The Arduino ModulinoÂ® Library simplifies the integration and management of ModulinoÂ® modules on Arduino boards. 

A ModulinoÂ® is a compact, modular electronic device that connects easily to Arduino via the Qwiic connector and communicates using the I2C (`Wire`) protocol. These modules include sensors, actuators, and more.

ðŸ“– For more information about this library please read the documentation [here](./docs/).

## Hardware Compatibility
This library is compatible with all Arduino boards that feature an I2C interface (`Wire`).
